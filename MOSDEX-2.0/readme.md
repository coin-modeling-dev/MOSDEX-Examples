New MOSDEX syntax summary:
-Eliminated named objects (Problems and Tables)
--All objects now have a keyword as field name
--The MOSDEX File has a Modules array
--The MOSDEX Module has a Tables array
--Problem has been renamed Module
-New syntax for schema
--Eliminated named fields in favor of two arrays: FIELDS and TYPES
--Horizontal layout aligns over the instance columns and eliminates a separate Fields array (this is not part of the standard; JSON doesnâ€™t care about the layout)
-Function calls
--Needed for retrieving the solution
--Define a data type for function calls for use in the schema
--Parse the function call from a string in the MOSDEX File
-Type (schema) information added in SELECT Queries
--MOSDEX supports data types (IEEEDOUBLE, Function calls) that are not supported in SQL.
--MOSDEX needs to carry this type information through its data transformations from input -> model -> output
--Solution: add the type information as comments (denoted by --) in the SQL 
-Solver result calls are specified as part of the relevant modeling object.
--Results can be reformatted as OUTPUT DATA tables using SQL.
-UPDATE query field added to table to facilitate iterative modular structures
--e.g. decomposition
